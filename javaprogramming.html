   <h1 style="text-align: center;"> <u>What is JAVA Programming</u></h1> <br>
   <p style="font-size: larger;">Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.<br>

    It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.<br>
    
    It is used for:<br>
    
    Mobile applications (specially Android apps)<br>
    Desktop applications<br>
    Web applications<br>
    Web servers and application servers<br>
    Games<br>
    Database connection<br>
    And much, much more!</p><br>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><u>Charachterstics of JAVA:</u></h1> <br>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">1.Object-oriented:<br>
        Java is an object-oriented language. Therefore, in Java everything is an object. The only exceptions are the primitive data types. In OOP, we deal with objects which mimic the real physical objects. Also, objects are identified by their state, behavior and identity.<br>
        2.Platform Independent:<br>
        Most noteworthy, characteristic of Java language is Platform Independence. Java programs are portable across multiple operating systems. Hence, java program can run on various operating systems like Windows , Linux etc without any modifications as shown below. “Write once, run anywhere” .<br>
        3.Complied & Interpreted:<br>
        Another, important characteristic is that Java is compiled & interpreted language: Java program is first compiled into bytecode. Bytecode can run on various target platforms. The bytecode is interpreted by the JVM.
        
        Another, interesting characteristic of Java is that, memory management is automatic. The programmer do not need to worry about the allocation and de-allocation of memory for objects. The garbage collector automatically takes care of deleting objects.
        
        In addition, Java is strongly typed language. The types of variables in Java need to be per-defined and conversion of objects is strict. Java is multi-threaded. Multi-threading enables programs to have more than one executions paths that execute concurrently. Its easy in Java to create threads for concurrent execution.</p><br>


<h1 style="text-align: center;"><u>Why we use JAVA?</u></h1> <br>
<p style="font-size: larger;">Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)<br>
    It is one of the most popular programming language in the world<br>
    It has a large demand in the current job market<br>
    It is easy to learn and simple to use<br>
    It is open-source and free<br>
    It is secure, fast and powerful<br>
    It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)<br>
    Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs<br>
    As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa</p><br>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><u>Explain 1D Array?</u></h1> <br>
<p style="font-size: larger;">An array is a collection of elements of one specific type in a horizontal fashion. The array in contention here is that of the one-dimensional array in Java programming.

    Anything having one-dimension means that there is only one parameter to deal with. In regular terms, it is the length of something. Similarly, as far as an array is concerned, one dimension means it has only one value per location or index.
    
    One-dimensional array in Java programming is an array with a bunch of values having been declared with a single index.</p><br>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><u>Expain 2D Array?</u></h1><br>
<p style="font-size: larger;"> Multidimensional arrays are used to store the data in a tabular form. For example, storing the roll number and marks of a student can be easily done using multidimensional arrays. Another common usage is to store the images in 3D arrays. <br>

    ● In dynamic programming questions, multidimensional arrays are used which are used to represent the states of the problem. <br>
    
    ● Apart from these, they also have applications in many standard algorithmic problems like:  Matrix Multiplication, Adjacency matrix representation in graphs, Grid search problems<br>
    
    Two – dimensional array is the simplest form of a multidimensional array. A two – dimensional array can be seen as an array of one – dimensional array for easier understanding. </p><br>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><u>Explain Strings?</u></h1><br>
<p style="font-size: larger;">Strings are the type of objects that can store the character of values and in Java, every character is stored in 16 bits i,e using UTF 16-bit encoding. A string acts the same as an array of characters in Java.<br>
Ways of Creating a String:<br>
There are two ways to create a string in Java:<br> 

string Literal<br>
Using new Keyword</p><br>
